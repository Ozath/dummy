# User manual

## Introduction

This is a brief user manual for the Bookcase application, which was a mandatory miniproject during the Software Engineering course at Helsinki University. It is intended for personal use to store reading tips (books, blogs, podcasts, etc) that relate to hobbies or studies. The user is able to add/remove, edit and search reading tips. The application is written in Java and it uses a SQlite database. The GUI is implemented using JavaFX.

## Installation

Please refer to the instructions in the [README.md](https://github.com/nothros/ohtu-miniprojekti2021/blob/main/README.md).

## Using the application

The application has three screen parts as seen below. The main display, see figure 1, lists five columns (title, author, type, tags, courses) of all reading tip items in the database in a table view. The sixth column contains a **"show"** button that gives further detailed information of the item in that row, as seen in figure 2. Above the table view there are two comboboxes. The top combobox lists the different types of library items (books, blogs and podcasts) available with an **"Add"** button on its right. The user can select an item type and press the **"Add"** button, see figure 3, to proceed to a textfield form where they can add items to their reading tips. The lower combobox enables the user to select a column (title, author, type) and search the table view for items with a keyword that is entered into the textfield.
