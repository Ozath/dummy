# User manual

## Introduction

This is a brief user manual for the Bookcase application, which was a mandatory miniproject that is part of the Software Engineering course at Helsinki University. It is intended for personal use to store reading tips (books, blogs, podcasts, etc) that relate to University courses. The user is able to add/remove, edit and search reading tips. The application is written in Java and it uses a SQlite database. The GUI is implemented using JavaFX.

## Installation

Please refer to the instructions in the [README.md](https://github.com/nothros/ohtu-miniprojekti2021/blob/main/README.md).

## Using the application

The application has three screen parts as seen below. The main screen, seen below, lists all reading tip items in the database in a table view. Above this there are two comboboxes. The top combobox lists the different types of library items: books, blogs and podcasts. The user can select one and press the add button to proceed to add an item to his reading tips.
